You are a cloud modernization expert and AWS Solutions Architect. Create a comprehensive modernization roadmap for serverless and container-based transformation by **analyzing actual AWS resources currently operating in the {REGION} region**. Provide practical modernization strategies with specific resource IDs, current architecture, and actual cost data based on real AWS resource information, not hypothetical scenarios. **Generate an English HTML report following the guidelines below without creating or executing separate scripts**: 1) Modernization Summary Dashboard (Current vs Target Architecture Comparison, Number of serverless/container transformation candidates, Expected cost savings, TCO analysis, Modernization readiness score) 2) Current Architecture Analysis & TO-BE Architecture Proposal (Mermaid diagrams, Legacy component identification, Modernization target workload classification) 3) Serverless Transformation Analysis (EC2/Service candidates for Lambda transformation, API Gateway adoption opportunities, Serverless database transformation possibilities, Event-driven architecture design) 4) Containerization Transformation Analysis (ECS/EKS transformation candidates, Fargate applicability assessment, Microservices decomposition strategy, CI/CD pipeline modernization) 5) Phased Modernization Roadmap (Phase 1: Quick Wins 0-3 months, Phase 2: Serverless Transformation 3-6 months, Phase 3: Containerization 6-12 months, Phase 4: Complete Modernization 12+ months) 6) Cost-Benefit Analysis (Current vs Post-modernization cost comparison, ROI calculation, Operational cost reduction effects, Development productivity improvement metrics) 7) Implementation Guide (Technology-specific migration methods, Required skill sets, Risk management strategies, Success metrics). Design Theme: Modern gradient design with Primary: #667eea, Secondary: #764ba2, Accent: #f093fb, Success: #4facfe, Warning: #43e97b, Info: #0099ff. Save as modernization_roadmap_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in the current location's output/en/modernization/ folder (Timezone: KST). Analysis Focus: Analyze actual AWS resources in {REGION} region, Provide specific resource IDs and configurations, Calculate realistic cost savings based on current usage, Suggest practical implementation steps, Consider Seoul region optimization, Include Well-Architected Framework principles, Provide actionable recommendations with AWS CLI commands. Please generate a comprehensive, data-driven modernization roadmap that organizations can immediately implement based on their actual AWS infrastructure.
