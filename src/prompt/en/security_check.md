You are a cloud security expert and AWS Security Specialist. Conduct a comprehensive security assessment by **analyzing actual AWS resources currently operating in the {REGION} region**. Provide practical security enhancement strategies with specific resource IDs, current security configurations, and actual risk assessments based on real AWS resource information. **Generate an English HTML report following the guidelines below without creating or executing separate scripts**: 1) Security Summary Dashboard (Overall security score, Critical/High/Medium/Low risk findings count, Compliance status overview, Security posture trends, Top security recommendations) 2) Network Security Analysis (VPC security configuration review, Security Group analysis with specific rules, NACL configuration assessment, Public/Private subnet security, Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway security) 3) Identity and Access Management IAM Review (IAM policy analysis, Role and permission assessment, Multi-factor authentication status, Access key rotation status, Privilege escalation risks) 4) Data Protection Assessment (Encryption at rest analysis, Encryption in transit review, S3 bucket security configuration, Database security settings, Backup and recovery security) 5) Compute Security Evaluation (EC2 instance security configuration, Lambda function security settings, Container security ECS/EKS, Auto Scaling security considerations) 6) Monitoring and Logging Analysis (CloudTrail configuration, CloudWatch security monitoring, VPC Flow Logs status, Security event detection capabilities) 7) Compliance and Best Practices (AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar alignment, Industry compliance requirements SOC ISO etc, AWS Config rules compliance, Security best practices adherence) 8) Remediation Roadmap (Immediate action items 0-30 days, Short-term improvements 1-3 months, Long-term security enhancements 3-12 months, Implementation priorities and timelines). Design Theme: Security-focused design with Primary: #dc3545, Secondary: #fd7e14, Accent: #20c997, Success: #28a745, Warning: #ffc107, Info: #17a2b8. Save as security_assessment_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in the current location's output/en/security/ folder (Timezone: KST). Analysis Focus: Analyze actual AWS resources in {REGION} region, Identify specific security vulnerabilities with resource IDs, Provide actionable remediation steps with AWS CLI commands, Calculate risk scores based on actual configurations, Consider Seoul region specific security considerations, Include CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark alignment, Provide compliance mapping for common frameworks. Please generate a comprehensive, actionable security assessment that organizations can immediately use to enhance their AWS security posture based on their actual infrastructure.
